To run the the python file, you need to download the PyBioMed package from the following repo: https://github.com/gadsbyfly/PyBioMed

# Description
Using the training_dataset.csv file, the python script generates a features.csv file. In the features file, various protein descriptors have been extracted. These can be used to start building our RapidMiner model. 

We can add or remove features later. This is just a starting point.
